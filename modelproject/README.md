# Model analysis project

My project is titled **The Cournot model of oligopoly** and is about how firms behave in a market with two firms compete in quantity of homogenous products. I am also analyzing how increasing marginal costs and a third firm entering the market affects the firms. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [ModelProject-sev.ipynb](modelproject-sev.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
